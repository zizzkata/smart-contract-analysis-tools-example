# kevm
To get in contact with the developers of the k-framework and kevm, go to the channel on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#k:matrix.org).

The specifications being checked for are described in [VeriToken-spec.md](./VeriToken-spec.md). Several examples from the kevm repo can be found [here](https://github.com/runtimeverification/evm-semantics/tree/master/tests/specs/examples).

## Running

You might need to run `sudo` on the command below.

```bash
$ ./run-VeriToken-spec.sh ../ VeriToken 2>&1 | tee VeriToken-kevm.result
```

If you see `#Top` at the end of the file it  means the specifications are met.

An example output of a **successful** spec can be found in [VeriToken-kevm.result](./kevm/VeriToken-kevm.result). 

An example output of a **failing** spec can be found in [VeriToken-kevm.failing-result](./kevm/VeriToken-kevm.failing-result). In the failing spec the we said that `decimals()` should return 18 (`<output> .ByteArray => #buf(32, 18) </output>`) while actually is should return 6 as described in [VeriToken-spec.md](./kevm/VeriToken-spec.md).
